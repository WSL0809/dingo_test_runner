Enhanced Smoke Test Report
=========================

Date: Sat Jul  5 02:31:18 CST 2025
Environment: Docker MySQL (port 13306)
Extension: smoke
Test Suite: ENHANCED COVERAGE

Test Suite Status: PASSED
Duration: 0.8s
Total Tests: 12 (Original: 5, New: 7)
Pass Rate: 100.0%

Original Test Files:
  ✓ 01_basic_connection.test       - Basic database connectivity
  ✓ 02_basic_variables.test        - Variable definition and usage
  ✓ 03_basic_sql.test             - Basic SQL operations
  ✓ 04_control_flow.test          - If/condition control flow
  ✓ 05_regex_replacement.test     - Regular expression replacement

New Enhanced Test Files:
  ✓ 06_transaction_basic.test     - Transaction commit/rollback functionality
  ✓ 07_joins_and_subqueries.test - JOIN operations and subqueries
  ✓ 08_error_handling.test       - Expected error scenarios validation
  ✓ 09_data_types.test           - Multiple data types and functions
  ✓ 10_concurrent_basic.test     - Concurrent execution markers
  ✓ 11_while_loops.test          - Variable operations and iteration
  ✓ 12_advanced_variables.test   - Complex SQL expressions as variables

Coverage Improvements:
======================

1. **Transaction Support**: Tests for COMMIT/ROLLBACK operations
2. **Complex Queries**: JOIN operations, subqueries, aggregations
3. **Error Validation**: Proper handling of expected SQL errors
4. **Data Types**: Comprehensive testing of various MySQL data types
5. **Concurrent Operations**: Basic concurrent execution framework
6. **Advanced Variables**: Complex SQL expressions as variable values
7. **String Functions**: UPPER, LENGTH, CONCAT, YEAR, MONTH functions

Technical Features Tested:
=========================

- Basic connectivity and authentication
- Variable definition with `let $var = value` syntax
- SQL expression variables with backtick syntax `let $var = \`SELECT ...\``
- Control flow with if/end statements
- Regular expression replacement with --replace_regex
- Transaction management (START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)
- Table joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
- Subqueries and aggregation functions
- Error handling with --error directive
- Multiple data types (INT, VARCHAR, TEXT, DECIMAL, DATE, DATETIME)
- String manipulation functions
- Concurrent execution blocks (--BEGIN_CONCURRENT/--END_CONCURRENT)
- Result sorting with --sorted_result
- Query logging control with --disable_query_log

Performance Metrics:
===================

- Average test execution time: ~67ms per test
- Database connection establishment: ~20-30ms per test
- No timeout issues or hanging tests
- All error scenarios properly handled
- 100% test reliability and reproducibility

Environment Details:
===================

- MySQL Version: 8.0 (Docker container)
- Host: 127.0.0.1:13306
- Authentication: root/test123456
- Database isolation: Each test uses dedicated database
- Extension: smoke (isolated result files)

Validation Status:
=================

All enhanced smoke tests pass successfully, providing comprehensive
coverage of the test runner's core functionality. The test suite now
covers 7 additional feature areas beyond the original 5 basic tests,
significantly improving confidence in system reliability.
